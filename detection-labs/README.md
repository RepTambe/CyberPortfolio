# Detection Labs

This folder contains my **hands-on detection engineering labs**.  
Each lab simulates adversary techniques and builds detections to catch them.

## Projects

- **Splunk Attack Lab** – Simulated adversary activity with Atomic Red Team + custom SPL detections  
- **Zeek/Suricata Lab** – Detecting DNS tunneling and C2 traffic  
- **Windows Event Log Detections** – Detecting PowerShell abuse (T1059.001) with MITRE ATT&CK mapping  

## Tools & Skills
- Splunk, Suricata, Zeek  
- Atomic Red Team, MITRE ATT&CK  
- Sigma, KQL, SPL
