# CyberPortfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my hands-on work in **detection engineering**, **cloud-native security**, and **incident response**.  
It’s organized into themed projects that demonstrate my ability to design, build, and document security detections.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- [cloud-infra/](cloud-infra/README.md) – Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes) to deploy detection platforms  
- [detection-labs/](detection-labs/README.md) – Simulated adversary labs with custom detections (Splunk, Sigma, Zeek, Suricata)  
- [analytics-notebooks/](analytics-notebooks/README.md) – Jupyter notebooks for log/alert analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization  
- [container-security/](container-security/README.md) – Supply chain and runtime security projects (cosign, Trivy, Falco)  
- [blog/](blog/README.md) – Writeups and documentation explaining my detection philosophy, attack simulations, and lessons learned
- [immersivelabs/](immersivelabs/README.md)

## 🎯 Goals of This Portfolio

- Show my ability to **engineer detections** across cloud and on-prem environments  
- Demonstrate **automation and scripting** with Python, IaC, and open-source tools  
- Highlight **threat-informed defense** by mapping detections to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Share my journey and **teach through documentation**, not just code
