# Immersive Labs Projects

This folder highlights my progress and takeaways from **Immersive Labs**, a hands-on cybersecurity learning platform.  
I use this space to document completed labs, key skills gained, and how I apply those lessons in detection engineering.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Showcase **completed labs** relevant to detection, incident response, and security engineering.  
- Document **key learning outcomes** from each lab.  
- Connect Immersive Labs training to **real-world detection projects** in this portfolio.  

---

## ðŸ§ª Completed Labs (Examples)

- **Windows Event Log Analysis**
  - Practiced detecting malicious PowerShell execution (MITRE ATT&CK T1059.001).  
  - Outcome: Built Sigma rules to alert on suspicious parent-child process chains.

- **Network Threat Hunting**
  - Explored malicious DNS tunneling activity using Suricata logs.  
  - Outcome: Developed detection logic for unusual domain entropy.

- **Cloud Security: IAM Misconfigurations**
  - Investigated privilege escalation risks in AWS IAM roles.  
  - Outcome: Designed a detection query for excessive privilege assignments in CloudTrail.

- **Incident Response Scenarios**
  - Simulated triaging phishing and ransomware cases in a lab environment.  
  - Outcome: Improved investigation speed by applying MITRE mappings and automating enrichment.

---

## ðŸ›  Skills Practiced

- Threat detection (Windows, Network, Cloud)  
- SIEM queries (Splunk SPL, KQL, Sigma)  
- Incident response workflows  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Threat intelligence enrichment  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Continue documenting labs by category (Windows, Network, Cloud, IR).  
- Create links between Immersive Lab outcomes and my **[detection-labs](../detection-labs/README.md)** projects.  
- Expand into Kubernetes/container-focused labs when available.
